Here's the English translation of your "About Me" section:

# Who am I? An engineer who wanted to design Teslas and ended up taming AI 🚀

Hi! I'm **Silvio Angelo Baratto Roldan** - yes, double surname, dual nationality, double espresso in the morning. Spanish mother, Italian father: I speak both languages fluently and gesture twice the European average.

## From Tesla dreams to Python plot twist

I started studying electronic engineering with dreams of working at Tesla. Small problem: circuits and I were as compatible as vim and emacs. But when I discovered I was way better with computers, I realized my destiny was bits, not volts. **Plot twist**: now I program AI that could drive those Teslas.

## The art of productive burnout

Post-bachelor's, total burnout. Solution? Go work at **Luxottica** (because nothing says "rest" like managing a team of 5 suppliers and implementing AGVs in production). There I discovered I could make **Naive Bayes** coexist with logistics and that predicting production problems was more fun than solving them. Bonus: I learned that managing people is like debugging, but with more coffee and less Stack Overflow.

## The comeback: From zero to ML hero

Recovered from burnout, I returned to university for my master's in **Data Science**. I got so passionate about deep learning that I created my own PyTorch library ([stockpy](https://github.com/SilvioBaratto/stockpy)) - because apparently I didn't have enough problems in my life. From there, the addiction to side projects became chronic.

## The European code tour

**Generali Investments**: I wanted to become a quant. I built a portfolio optimizer in Streamlit. The trauma was so severe that I'm now an evangelist for **Angular + FastAPI**. Lesson learned: software architecture is like pasta - if you do it badly, everyone notices.

**European Central Bank**: 8 months in Frankfurt developing LLM solutions to standardize financial datasets and analyze sentiment. I learned that "regulatory reporting" is the fancy way of saying "turning Excel into something usable." I created Python libraries for FinREP while discussing macroeconomics with Europe's brightest minds. Stimulating? Absolutely. Technically challenging? Let's say I needed more adrenaline.

## Present: EY and the AI factory

I'm now at **EY**, where in less than a year I've:
- 🤖 Built RAG systems that make ChatGPT look like a beginner
- 📚 Created legal classification platforms (because lawyers deserve some AI too)
- 🔒 Developed anonymization systems with 3B models on Ollama (privacy first!)
- 🚀 Deployed everything on **Azure** in Docker containers (because "works on my machine" isn't a deployment strategy)
- 🎨 Built frontends in **React** and **Angular** with Tailwind CSS (yes, I can center a div)

## Tech stack: My arsenal

**Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Flask, LlamaIndex, BAML  
**Frontend**: Angular, React, Tailwind CSS (responsive and beautiful, always)  
**AI/ML**: RAG Systems, NLP, LLM, PyTorch  
**DevOps**: Docker, Azure, CI/CD  
**Database**: If it exists, I've probably queried it

## The future?

My goal is simple: become the best technician on the market. And yes, get rich too - at least enough to buy that Tesla I never designed.

**P.S.**: If you're looking for someone who transforms ambitious ideas into production-ready code, manages teams without losing their sanity, and does all this while telling terrible jokes about Python... here I am!
